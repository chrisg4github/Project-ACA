"Definitions"
"*State-based Marketplace*: States running a State-based Marketplace are responsible for performing all Marketplace functions for both the individual market and the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in these states apply for and enroll in coverage through Marketplace websites established and maintained by the states."
""
"*State-based Marketplace-Federal Platform*: States with this type of Marketplace are considered to have a State-based Marketplace, and are responsible for performing all Marketplace functions for the individual market and the SHOP, except that the state will rely on the Federally-facilitated Marketplace IT platform. Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in these states apply for and enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov."
""
"*State-Partnership Marketplace* States entering into a Partnership Marketplace conduct plan management and may administer in-person consumer assistance; HHS performs the remaining Marketplace functions. Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in states with a Partnership Marketplace apply for and enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov."
""
"*Federally-facilitated Marketplace*: In a Federally-facilitated Marketplace, HHS performs all Marketplace functions. Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in states with a Federally-facilitated Marketplace apply for and enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov."


Footnotes
"1. Arkansas and New Mexico have established state-administered websites for the SHOP marketplace. Small employers and their employees apply for coverage through these state websites, not healthcare.gov."
"2. Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Virginia have received approval from HHS to conduct plan management activities to support certification of qualified health plans in the Federally-facilitated Marketplace."
"3. Mississippi and Utah operate the SHOP marketplace; the federal government operates the individual marketplace in these states."
